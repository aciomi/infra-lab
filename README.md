# Airflow SRE Practice

## Intro

Hello this is my infrastructure lab or **infra-lab** for short. This will be a random yet organized repo of the tools I am currently learning. 
I will try my best to avoid any errors in my code but trial and error is the road to success. By the end of this, I hope to have a well
organized infra-lab repo with examples and small projects where you can one day clone it and use it to learn such tools you are looking to learn.

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request.
